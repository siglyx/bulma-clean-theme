# Technology

At SIGLYX, we develop technology to enable low-code, homogenous & efficient processing 
of Big data collections and ultra-long sensor data series. Our vision is to overcome the
sub-optimal fit of modern Big Data/Big Stream architectures and technology stacks specifically
for continuous sensor data, a need currently addressed mostly by bespoke solutions.
Our technology allows for the extraction of insights and value from data that are currently
not fully exploitable, using highly optimized implementations to significantly reduce
processing costs.

# Prospective partners & ecosystems

A significant part of our product strategy is to synchronise our internal development plan
with our collaboration with the right partners, ecosystems and prospective users of our technology.
We realise that the adoption of our technology heavily lies on the “fit” to evolving solution
stacks, architectures, ecosystems and business models – definitely not only on its stand-alone
perceived value. We seek to be involved in research projects, feasibility studies, analyses and
discourses relevant to some extent to our technology and wish to contribute our capabilities and
expertise while hopefully optimising our product strategy along the way.
