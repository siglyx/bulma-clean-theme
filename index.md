# Motivation

Have you tried to manage your sensor data, only to realise that modern
architectures and technology stacks are not really optimised to applying
DSP methods?
Or to managing and processing data that is continuous and not inherently segmented?
Did you need to develop bespoke solutions to tackle the problem and perhaps found
the cost to render the project infeasible?
SIGLYX is a tech startup from Athens, Greece, founded by computer scientists who have
come across these problems multiple times and have embarked to develop a solution.

# Technology

At SIGLYX, we develop technology to enable low-code, homoge-nous & efficient processing 
of Big data collections and ultra-long sensor data series. Our vision is to overcome the
sub-optimal fit of modern Big Data/Big Stream architectures and technology stacks specifically
for continuous sensor data, a need currently addressed mostly by bespoke solutions.
Our technology allows for the extraction of insights and value from data that are currently
not fully exploitable, using highly optimized implementations to significantly reduce
processing costs.

# Prospective partners & ecosystems

A significant part of our product strategy is to synchronise our internal development plan
with our collaboration with the right partners, ecosystems and prospective users of our technology.
We realise that the adoption of our technology heavily lies on the “fit” to evolving solution
stacks, architectures, ecosystems and business models – definitely not only on its stand-alone
perceived value. We seek to be involved in research projects, feasibility studies, analyses and
discourses relevant to some extent to our technology and wish to contribute our capabilities and
expertise while hopefully optimising our product strategy along the way.

# Get in touch!

Do you have a project in which you could use our expertise? Are you interested in evaluating
a joint research proposal? Would you perhaps like to evaluate whether we can optimise parts 
of your existing solution? Contact us!
