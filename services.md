# Scaling up Existing Solutions

You collect sensor data, which you use to optimize production,
trigger alarms, and, in general manage assets and processes. You are
very satisfied with the analytics you have developed over the years,
but as your data pool is growing it is becoming harder and harder to
go back and re-analyse historical data, look for similar situations,
and, in general, gain insights from your ultra-long data streams:
Processing costs are becomeing excessive or your software simply
cannot handle data streams of this length.

We can design and implement the transition of your analytics and
your workflows to _scalable_ and _efficient_ solutions;
leveraging our experience in using the well-known tools of the Big
Data ecosystem and our in-house proprietary scalable signal processing
tools.


# Solution Design and Implementation

You collect, or are planning to collect, vast amounts of sensor data
and you need a solution that will extract value from this data with
the minimal computational costs and CO2 footprint.

We can consult on what computational model best suits your needs (on
premises, private Cloud, IaaS, or SaaS), design a scalable and
efficient system for data management and processing, and develop or
co-develop with your efficient and scalable analytics.
