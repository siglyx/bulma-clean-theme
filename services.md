# Areas and Technologies

Our core expertise is the extraction of insights and value from Big
Data with an emphasis on the efficient processing of Big Stream data
(sensor data or other streams), joining multiple (Big) streams, and
joining with stationary (Big) data and external data. We have
conducted academic _and_ industrial research and development in these
areas, from developing ideas and advanced prototypes, to contributing
to the open source Big Data ecosystem, to developing production
software.

Besides the technologies of the Big Data ecosystem, we are also
experts in Knowledge Graphs and related technologies for data
integration and provenance tracking, including contributing to the
relevant international standardization proceducres of the W3C.
Finally, our expertise spans several strands of data analytics,
from AI/ML, to statistical inference, to digital signal processing,
again from advanced research prototypes to production software.

We are also proficient in Cloud technologies and the DevOps state of
the art, and we can ensure that our solutions can be deployed on our
clients' own infrastructures or private Cloud, as well as the public
Cloud. We take pride in developing solutions that are optimized to
deliver results both efficiently and at the lowest possible computing
costs and carbon footprint.


# Services

We can support during the complete lifecycle of application
development, deployment, and monitoring, from requirements capturing
and feasibility analysis, to solution definition, technology
selection, software architecture development, to software design and
development. We can study your existing workflows and design the
minimally disruptive integration with or migration to new solutions.

We can accommodate different planning and management models,
including agile developemnt and delivering in scrums.

Naturally, we can be involved in the testing, quality assurance, and
post-deployment monitoring of the solution together with your team.
