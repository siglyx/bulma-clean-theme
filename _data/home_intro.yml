      Have you tried to manage your sensor data, only to realise that modern
      architectures and technology stacks are not really optimised to applying
      DSP methods?
      Or to managing and processing data that is continuous and not inherently segmented?
      Did you need to develop bespoke solutions to tackle the problem and perhaps found
      that the cost renders the project infeasible?

      come across these problems multiple times and have embarked to develop a solution.
